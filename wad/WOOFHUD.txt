//REMARKS
// HUD modes without a paragraph remain unchanged.
//
// Widgets which are not mentioned in a paragraph will never be visible in the respective HUD mode.
// It is a good idea to always include the five widgets which make up the hud 0 paragraph in any other paragraph.
//
// The "title" widget is only visible if the Automap is enabled.
// The "monsec", "sttime" and "coord" widgets are only visible if explicitly enabled in the Options menu (separately for Automap and HUD).
// The "fps" widget is only visible if the SHOWFPS cheat is enabled.
